## deletePage

> deletePage(id, purge, draft)

Delete page

Delete a page by id.  By default this will delete pages that are non-drafts. To delete a page that is a draft, the endpoint must be called on a  draft with the following param &#x60;draft&#x3D;true&#x60;. Discarded drafts are not sent to the trash and are permanently deleted.  Deleting a page moves the page to the trash, where it can be restored later. To permanently delete a page (or \&quot;purge\&quot; it), the endpoint must be called on a **trashed** page with the following param &#x60;purge&#x3D;true&#x60;.  **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: Permission to view the page and its corresponding space. Permission to delete pages in the space. Permission to administer the space (if attempting to purge).

## getPagesInSpace

> MultiEntityResultPage getPagesInSpace(id, depth, sort, status, title, bodyFormat, cursor, limit)

Get pages in space

Returns all pages in a space. The number of results is limited by the &#x60;limit&#x60; parameter and additional results (if available) will be available through the &#x60;next&#x60; URL present in the &#x60;Link&#x60; response header.  **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: Permission to access the Confluence site (\&#39;Can use\&#39; global permission) and \&#39;View\&#39; permission for the space. Only pages that the user has permission to view will be returned.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  PageApi,
} from '';
import type { GetPagesInSpaceRequest } from '';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing  SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // To configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
    username: "YOUR USERNAME",
    password: "YOUR PASSWORD",
    // To configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oAuthDefinitions accessCode
    accessToken: "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new PageApi(config);

  const body = {
    // number | The ID of the space for which pages should be returned.
    id: 789,
    // 'all' | 'root' | Filter the results to pages at the root level of the space or to all pages in the space. (optional)
    depth: depth_example,
    // PageSortOrder | Used to sort the result by a particular field. (optional)
    sort: ...,
    // Array<'current' | 'archived' | 'deleted' | 'trashed'> | Filter the results to pages based on their status. By default, `current` and `archived` are used. (optional)
    status: ...,
    // string | Filter the results to pages based on their title. (optional)
    title: title_example,
    // PrimaryBodyRepresentation | The content format types to be returned in the `body` field of the response. If available, the representation will be available under a response field of the same name under the `body` field. (optional)
    bodyFormat: ...,
    // string | Used for pagination, this opaque cursor will be returned in the `next` URL in the `Link` response header. Use the relative URL in the `Link` header to retrieve the `next` set of results. (optional)
    cursor: cursor_example,
    // number | Maximum number of pages per result to return. If more results exist, use the `Link` header to retrieve a relative URL that will return the next set of results. (optional)
    limit: 56,
  } satisfies GetPagesInSpaceRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.getPagesInSpace(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
