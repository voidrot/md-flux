## deleteBlogPost

> deleteBlogPost(id, purge, draft)

Delete blog post

Delete a blog post by id.  By default this will delete blog posts that are non-drafts.

Discarded drafts are not sent to the trash and are permanently deleted.  Deleting a blog post that is not a draft moves the blog post to the trash, where it can be restored later. To permanently delete a blog post (or \&quot;purge\&quot; it), the endpoint must be called on a **trashed** blog post with the following param &#x60;purge&#x3D;true&#x60;.  **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: Permission to view the blog post and its corresponding space. Permission to delete blog posts in the space. Permission to administer the space (if attempting to purge).
