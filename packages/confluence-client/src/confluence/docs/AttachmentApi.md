## deleteAttachment

> deleteAttachment(id, purge)

Delete attachment

Delete an attachment by id.  Deleting an attachment moves the attachment to the trash, where it can be restored later. To permanently delete an attachment (or \&quot;purge\&quot; it), the endpoint must be called on a **trashed** attachment with the following param &#x60;purge&#x3D;true&#x60;.  **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: Permission to view the container of the attachment. Permission to delete attachments in the space. Permission to administer the space (if attempting to purge).

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  AttachmentApi,
} from '';
import type { DeleteAttachmentRequest } from '';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing  SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // To configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
    username: "YOUR USERNAME",
    password: "YOUR PASSWORD",
    // To configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oAuthDefinitions accessCode
    accessToken: "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new AttachmentApi(config);

  const body = {
    // number | The ID of the attachment to be deleted.
    id: 789,
    // boolean | If attempting to purge the attachment. (optional)
    purge: true,
  } satisfies DeleteAttachmentRequest;

Get attachments for page

Returns the attachments of specific page. The number of results is limited by the &#x60;limit&#x60; parameter and additional results (if available) will be available through the &#x60;next&#x60; URL present in the &#x60;Link&#x60; response header.  **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: Permission to view the content of the page and its corresponding space.

    id: 789,
    // AttachmentSortOrder | Used to sort the result by a particular field. (optional)
    sort: ...,
